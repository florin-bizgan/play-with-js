## Variables

Variables are containers for storing data values. In JavaScript, we use the `var`, `let`, or `const` keyword to declare variables.

```javascript
var name = 'John Doe';
let age = 30;
const isAdult = true;
```

## Data Types

JavaScript supports various data types, including numbers, strings, booleans, objects, arrays, functions, and more.

```javascript
let count = 42; // Number
let message = 'Hello, World!'; // String
let isTrue = true; // Boolean
let person = { name: 'John', age: 30 }; // Object
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; // Array

let greet = function (name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}; // Function
```

## Operators

Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values. JavaScript supports various types of operators, such as arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical, and more.

### Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations.

```javascript
let sum = 10 + 5; // Addition
let difference = 10 - 5; // Subtraction
let product = 10 * 5; // Multiplication
let quotient = 10 / 5; // Division
let remainder = 10 % 3; // Modulus
```

### Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

```javascript
let x = 10;
x += 5; // Equivalent to x = x + 5
```

### Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare two values and return a boolean result.

```javascript
let a = 10;
let b = 5;

console.log(a > b); // true
console.log(a === b); // false
```

### Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to combine or modify boolean values.

```javascript
let sunny = true;
let warm = false;

console.log(sunny && warm); // false
console.log(sunny || warm); // true
console.log(!sunny); // false
```

### Bitwise Operators

Bitwise operators perform bitwise operations on binary representations of numbers.

```javascript
let x = 5; // binary: 101
let y = 3; // binary: 011

console.log(x & y); // 1 (binary: 001, bitwise AND)
console.log(x | y); // 7 (binary: 111, bitwise OR)
console.log(x ^ y); // 6 (binary: 110, bitwise XOR)
```

### Unary Operators

Unary operators act on a single operand.

```javascript
let x = 5;

console.log(-x); // -5 (negation)
console.log(++x); // 6 (increment)
console.log(--x); // 5 (decrement)
```

### Ternary Operator

The ternary operator is a conditional operator that assigns a value based on a condition.

```javascript
let age = 20;
let message = age >= 18 ? 'You are an adult' : 'You are a minor';
console.log(isAdult); // 'You are an adult'
```
